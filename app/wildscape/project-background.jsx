                            The SASE Hackathon had 31 team submissions and approximately 124 participants involved, all
                            competing for $3,750 in prizes. 2024's theme was LifeHacks, focusing on the 4 stages of
                            growth:
                            Childhood, Adolescence, Adult, and Elderly. Teams could choose ONE track and come up with an
                            idea following its sub-topic
                            guidelines, and we chose the adolescence track with an environmental social impact side.

                            Our UI team had a really great job funneling how we wanted this to go, and the majority of

                            database and backend setup, we selected Pocketbase.

                            We believe Wildscape has a great user concept behind it. In the future, we really want to
                            expand beyond the time limit we were given. Wildscape deserves a more integrated approach
                            with
                            Google Maps API, such that it can go directly in POV mode to see the spot. Additionally,
                            implementing AI to
                            differentiate between real nature photos, AI photos, and spam photos would help keep our
                            dashboard and mission
                            values rich. It would also be great to turn this into a mobile app, along with partnering
                            with environmental sustainability
                            stakeholders, such as the National Park Service.
