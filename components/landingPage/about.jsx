                    It was straight up a fan page for Master Chief and Blue Team, experimenting with the semantic tags.
                    It is lost somewhere in the archives, and all I can remember is that every image was used with
                    absolute positioning, nothing else.

                    Since then, I&#39;ve grown up alongside the web and design â€” death of Flash, skeuomorphism, dark
                    mode, and now potentially glassmorphism with Apple.
                    Along the way, I completed my computer science degree in 3 years, focusing on UI/UX and telling
                    digital stories that resemble your mission and audience.

                    I live and thrive in the Greater Boston area. I&#39;ve been to Japan two times. I love minimalism. I abuse Pinterest. Tuna Crudo from Riverhouse in Portsmouth, NH is the best.
